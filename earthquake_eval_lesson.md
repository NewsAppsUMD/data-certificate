Now you will try to generate automated earthquake sentences using what we learned in the last lesson. 


### Open the work file
|||info
## Open the file `eval1-earthquake-sentences.Rmd`
Within RStudio, open the file by selecting: `File` -> `Open File` -> `workspace` -> `r-files` -> `eval1-earthquake-sentences.Rmd`

Run the first two code blocks to load the tidyverse and your data. The data, from the USGS, contains all earthquakes worldwide from the past month.



### Generate earthquake sentences
Create automated sentences for earthquakes that meet criteria you choose. Replace ___ in the 3rd code block following the instructions below:

1. Choose a minimum magnitude (e.g., 4.5, 5.0, 6.0)
2. Choose a location to search for (e.g., "California", "Alaska", "Indonesia", "Mexico")
3. Complete the filter criteria using your choices
4. Run your code block to generate sentences
5. Save your file

**Hint:** Make sure your magnitude is a number (no quotes) and your location is in quotes.
