```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## 2. Load data

2. Pick a location (e.g., "California", "Alaska", "Indonesia", "Mexico")
3. Fill in the blanks below with your choices

```{r}
# Filter the data
filtered_earthquakes <- earthquakes |>
  filter(mag >= ___ & str_detect(place, "___"))

# Generate sentences
earthquake_sentences <- filtered_earthquakes |>
  mutate(
    date = format(time, "%B %d, %Y"),
    time_formatted = format(time, "%H:%M:%S UTC"),
    sentence = glue::glue("At {time_formatted} on {date}, an earthquake of {mag} was recorded {place}.")
  )

# Display the sentences
earthquake_sentences |>
  select(sentence) |>
  pull()
